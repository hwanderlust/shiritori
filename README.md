# Shiritori
Shiritori (しりとり) is a Japanese word game where you take the last letter or kana of the previous word and provide a word that begins with the same kana. It's a wonderful educational and competitive game for Japanese language learners!

# Rules / Guidelines
1. You have x amount of seconds (can be adjusted in Settings) to use the last letter of the starting or previous word to enter a word starting with the same letter. For example if the word is かに (crab), then you could enter にほんご as a possible entry.
2. Submitted words cannot be repeated in the same round and all Japanese alphabets are accepted (hiragana, katakana, and kanji).
3. If the word is katakana, then it will not be accepted as hiragana; i.e. れすとらん will not be accepted.
4. Also, words requiring another word *may not* be accepted. For example, take だけ, you normally need something preceding it to use like ゲームだけ. This includes counters and the like such as さつ [counter for books], ねん [counter for number of years], or じ [indicator for o’clock]. It depends on what Jisho.org has in their databases.
5. Included music can be listened to! This is purely for educational purposes and therefore no copyright infringement, if any, is intended.
