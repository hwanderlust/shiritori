# Shiritori
Shiritori (しりとり) is a Japanese word game where you take the last letter or kana of the previous word and provide a word that begins with the same kana. It's a wonderful educational and competitive game for Japanese language learners!

# MVP
A functional game using only JLPT's (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) N5 vocabulary as the foundation to limit and ease the incremental development of this side project.

# Rules
1. You have 30 seconds to use the last letter of the starting or previous word to enter a word starting with the same letter. For example if the word is かに (crab), then you could enter にほんご as a possible entry.
2. Submitted words cannot be repeated in the same game session and all inputs are to be in hiragana or katakana--kanji will not be accepted.
3. Words with the same spelling in hiragana but different kanji count as the same word and cannot be repeated. For example, 熱い, 厚い, and 暑い have different meanings but all spelled as あつい and thus it can be used only once during each game.
4. If the word is katakana, then it will not be accepted as hiragana; i.e. れすとらん will not be accepted.
5. Also, words requiring another word will not be accepted. For example, take だけ, you normally need something preceding it to use like ゲームだけ. This includes counters and the like such as さつ [counter for books], ねん [counter for number of years], or じ [indicator for o’clock].
